Now that I had the data on my computer and cleaned, I though that most was done, there's still some work you know, clean, analyze and do some crazy XGBoost stuff, the data is collected so it's good! 

Say that i was very hard and that I quit multiple times because of that step. I stoped for a month, then two and then I put it behind me but a post on Linkedin making me excited about how to label the data easierly, make me go back again. This is how I labelled the data, and all the techniques that I used.
