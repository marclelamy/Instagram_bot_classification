# Project description
This project has for a goal to correctly predict legit users from bots on Instagram with simple public features like comment likes, follower count, post counts, etc.

The project is divided into five steps: 
* Data Collection: Started by collecting the posts ids from pages targeted by bots (mercedesamgf1, nba, nfl, etc), then looped through the posts, collected comments, 140k. From the comments, looped through the usernames, and collected public data like profile infos, profile picture and last 12 posts for 90k unique users
* Data Cleaning: This is where I cleaned and transform the raw data into something consumable
* Data Labelling: Used different techniques of manual/semi-manual/automatic labelling to label the users

* EDA and data preprocessing: Exploring and prepare the data for model dev 
* Model development & optimization: 


# Status of the project
